## Projects

### 1. **Text Classification Models**
Implemented machine learning models such as **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** to classify textual data. These models are trained on a variety of datasets, including spam detection and news categorization, using Scikit-learn for efficient model training and testing.

#### Key Features:
- Preprocessing data using **TF-IDF** vectorization for improved feature extraction.
- Comparing model performance through metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**.
- Visualizing model performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis on WallStreetBets Posts**
This project explores community sentiment trends on Reddit’s **WallStreetBets** using **DistilBART**, a transformer-based model. By leveraging transfer learning, the model can accurately classify user sentiment in financial posts, providing insights into market sentiment.

#### Key Features:
- Data collection and preprocessing of Reddit posts using Python’s **PRAW** library.
- Fine-tuning the **DistilBART** model for sentiment analysis.
- Exploring and visualizing sentiment trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Application of **transfer learning** for more accurate predictions on financial sentiment.

### 3. **Amazon Trusted AI Challenge**
Participated in the **Amazon Trusted AI Challenge** to implement ethical AI principles while building machine learning models. This project focused on ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency in model outputs.

#### Key Features:
- Addressing bias in data preprocessing and model selection.
- Ensuring interpretability of model outputs through **SHAP** and **LIME** visualizations.
- Applying best practices for ethical AI in model development.
